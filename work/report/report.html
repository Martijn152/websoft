        <h2>S01</h2>
        <p>The general techniques of Git and GitHub were know to me, I had never worked with GitHub Pages before. I had
            also never fokrked a repository before. I have worked on repositories with other people and by myself
            before, but never used the forking functionality, always just branching. I have never worked with Markdown.
            I have never attached tags to any commit before.</p>
        <p>I have created several small websites using html and css. These were mostly to support programming with
            php.</p>
        <p>I have created several small web applications. I have worked with php using things like loops and statements,
            nothing advanced. I have a little experience with inserting javascript code into html documents, but this
            knowledge is very limited. I have also used Java Servlets before to create web applications. I have also
            created a system using a REST architecture before.</p>
        <p>I learned to set up the GitHub Pages functionality. I also learned that an html page called index.html will
            be displayed if a folder is targeted that contains that html page. I learned to attach tags to commit to
            disply the release version of that commit.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>S02</h2>
        <p>I have some experience with html and css. I have made several website using html and an occasional one using
            css, although my css knowledge is very little. I have used JavaScipt once before and only in a single case.
            My JavaScript knowledge is absolutely minimal.</p>
        <p>According to MDN one can state that HTML defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is used to
            determine the nature of different elements on a page and for a part how they are displayed. CSS defines the
            way elements are displayed and presented. It changes the rules of how to display the page. These rules can
            be used all over the page, it is not necessary to change things everwhere it is used. JavaScript describes
            the behaviour of web content. It can be used to make a page do things. It can also be used outside of web
            development.</p>
        <p>The browser sends an HTTP request to the web server for a specific page. The browser then returns an HTTP
            response which may contain the requested page in an HTML format for example.</p>
        <p>I learned some syntaxes for html (such as linking the stylesheet). I also learned about some semantic
            elements in HTML (such as header and footer). Finally I learned some syntax of css and roughly how it will
            influence the html page it is linked to.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>S03</h2>
        <p>I did not really have any previous experience with using javascript in separate files. I had used javascript a little bit by directly inserting it into an html file. Furthermore, this code was borrowed from someone else and I did not fully understand it yet.</p>
        <p>JavaScript seems similar in basics to Java and php, regarding things like variables and such. In general it also seems pretty similar to Java, using objects with attributes and methods/functions and such.</p>
        <p>I took the assignment simply step by step. I started with all the requirements for grade 3 and then worked on to the grade 5 requirements. One of the trickier parts for me was getting the JSON files locally at the very start. After that just taking it step by step worked fine.</p>
        <p>I learned:</p>
        <p> - How to set file preference in Chrome from XML to JSON</p>
        <p> - How to work with JavaScript objects, including setting parameter</p>
        <p> - How to create and specify transitions using CSS</p>
        <p> - How to parse and use JSON data in JavaScript</p>
        <p> - How to manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript</p>
        <p> - How to use the fetch system to get data from different sources</p>
        <p> - How to use some functions of canvas elements in HTML</p>
        <p> - How to create a relatively dynamic object in HTML with the help of JavaScript</p>
