        <h2>S01</h2>
        <p>The general techniques of Git and GitHub were know to me, I had never worked with GitHub Pages before. I had
            also never fokrked a repository before. I have worked on repositories with other people and by myself
            before, but never used the forking functionality, always just branching. I have never worked with Markdown.
            I have never attached tags to any commit before.</p>
        <p>I have created several small websites using html and css. These were mostly to support programming with
            php.</p>
        <p>I have created several small web applications. I have worked with php using things like loops and statements,
            nothing advanced. I have a little experience with inserting javascript code into html documents, but this
            knowledge is very limited. I have also used Java Servlets before to create web applications. I have also
            created a system using a REST architecture before.</p>
        <p>I learned to set up the GitHub Pages functionality. I also learned that an html page called index.html will
            be displayed if a folder is targeted that contains that html page. I learned to attach tags to commit to
            disply the release version of that commit.</p>

        <h2>S02</h2>
        <p>I have some experience with html and css. I have made several website using html and an occasional one using
            css, although my css knowledge is very little. I have used JavaScipt once before and only in a single case.
            My JavaScript knowledge is absolutely minimal.</p>
        <p>According to MDN one can state that HTML defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is used to
            determine the nature of different elements on a page and for a part how they are displayed. CSS defines the
            way elements are displayed and presented. It changes the rules of how to display the page. These rules can
            be used all over the page, it is not necessary to change things everwhere it is used. JavaScript describes
            the behaviour of web content. It can be used to make a page do things. It can also be used outside of web
            development.</p>
        <p>The browser sends an HTTP request to the web server for a specific page. The browser then returns an HTTP
            response which may contain the requested page in an HTML format for example.</p>
        <p>I learned some syntaxes for html (such as linking the stylesheet). I also learned about some semantic
            elements in HTML (such as header and footer). Finally I learned some syntax of css and roughly how it will
            influence the html page it is linked to.</p>

        <h2>S03</h2>
        <p>I did not really have any previous experience with using javascript in separate files. I had used javascript
            a little bit by directly inserting it into an html file. Furthermore, this code was borrowed from someone
            else and I did not fully understand it yet.</p>
        <p>JavaScript seems similar in basics to Java and php, regarding things like variables and such. In general it
            also seems pretty similar to Java, using objects with attributes and methods/functions and such.</p>
        <p>I took the assignment simply step by step. I started with all the requirements for grade 3 and then worked on
            to the grade 5 requirements. One of the trickier parts for me was getting the JSON files locally at the very
            start. After that just taking it step by step worked fine.</p>
        <p>I learned:</p>
        <p> - How to set file preference in Chrome from XML to JSON</p>
        <p> - How to work with JavaScript objects, including setting parameter</p>
        <p> - How to create and specify transitions using CSS</p>
        <p> - How to parse and use JSON data in JavaScript</p>
        <p> - How to manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript</p>
        <p> - How to use the fetch system to get data from different sources</p>
        <p> - How to use some functions of canvas elements in HTML</p>
        <p> - How to create a relatively dynamic object in HTML with the help of JavaScript</p>

        <h2>S04</h2>
        <p>I did not have any previous experience with programming tools like node and npm.</p>
        <p>Node and Express seem to form a good framework to build larger and more interactive websites on. Node and
            Express are not easy to work with when you start out and need some practice to get working well. Things like
            getting the information in request headers takes some searching to find.</p>
        <p>I did not have any notable plan for the coding assignment. My usual way of doing these takes a few steps.
            First, I start with reading the lecture notes. Then I read the articles suggested (the Node and Express
            articles in this cas). After that I start with the actual assignment. When I get stuck I try to refer to the
            lectures or articles and after that I will search the Internet.</p>
        <p>I aimed for grade 5. The difference between the tasks for grade 4 and grade 5 was very small. The harder step
            was getting from grade 3to grade 4.</p>
        <p>I learned:</p>
        <p> - The basics of working with npm, Node and Express</p>
        <p> - How to structure an express server using routers and middleware</p>
        <p> - How to fetch query data from http requests in an express router</p>
        <p> - How to add static webpages to an node/express server</p>

        <h2>S05</h2>
        <p>I appreciate PHP. It allows for very modular design with it's include function. I also like how it is really
            easy to work it into your HTML file, since it can basically be placed anywhere on the page.</p>
        <p>PHP reminds me mostly of Python, as well as JavaScript a little. It feels very different from Java with
            declaring variables for example. The way it integrates in HTML is something I have not really seen
            before.</p>
        <p>I took pretty much the same plan as in the last coding exercise. For this one, however, the lectures I found
            were only in Swedish and therefore not very helpful.</p>
        <p>I (re-)learned:</p>
        <p> - How to use PHP in its basic form, declaring variables and such</p>
        <p> - How to split page into common parts and use those efficiently using PHP inclusion</p>
        <p> - How to run PHP with the XAMPP package</p>
        <p> - How to access the MySQL database in the XAMPP package</p>
        <p> - How to access MySQL using PHP</p>
        <p> - How to use URLs to pass data between PHP files</p>

        <h2>S06</h2>
        <p>I think having popular programming languages is tremendously important and beneficial. The fact that most
            programmers will know these languages allows for great amounts of collaboration. This in itself is a great
            boon to the world of software development. If it would be possible, bringing all programming languages
            together to a few that suit all needs would be ideal.</p>
        <p>I am interested in programming languages for which I feel they suit the current need I have. In addition to
            this, I want the language to feel like I do not have to do things that feel unnecessary or redundant to make
            things work.</p>
        <p>See my comparison below. It looks like C++ interest has slowly been going down since the start of the
            comparison. The decrease in interest has slowed down in the recent years. There is a passing point around
            2012 where Python interest passed C++ interest, mostly because of the decrease of interest in C++.</p>
        <p><img src="img/comparison.png" width="400" alt="Comparison image"></p>
        <p>Since there are so many languages that I do not have experience with, it is hard to recommend one fully.
            There is simply so much that I don't know that it would feel quite close-minded to already recommend
            something. However, if I had to choose at this very moment I would most likely recommend PHP for it's
            capabilities as a server side programming language for web development.</p>
        <p>I don't feel I learned much in this section. The lectures were hard to follow by only reading since they are
            mostly key words. I suppose I have learned of the existence of a bunch of frameworks for JavaScript and
            PHP.</p>
